23. Given a matrix containing only 0’s and 1’s. Each row will have some number of consecutive 0’s followed by some number of consecutive 1’s. We have to find the row containing maximum 0’s and also the number of 0’s in that row. At first, I suggested implementing Binary Search on every row to find the number of zeroes and then comparing the number of zeroes for every row. The interviewers said it is right but they wanted something better. Then I suggested implementing Binary Search on first row, store the index containing last 0 and then moving down in the matrix on that index. If you encounter a 1, then you can safely ignore that row. If you get a 0, then you can implement Binary Search on that row and update your stored values. The interviewers were satisfied with this solution.

57. Given an “insertions” list and a BST constructed from the insertions list by inserting elements from first to last,
find all such possible insertion lists that would form the same BST as given in the input.

Eg: Given input insertion list (10, 2, 1, 7, 14, 12) and the BST10
/    \
2       14
/  \       /
1     7    12
one possible insertion list would be (10, 14, 2, 1, 7, 12) since inserting the nodes from first to last in that order would yield the same BST as above.
another such insertion list would be (10, 2, 14, 7, 1, 12)

62. Implement a custom iterator in java – there is a list of list (List<List<Integer>>). Write both – hasNext() and next() methods in such a way that hasNext() method should return true if the next list in the main list has some element present and next() method should return that element. Example: list – [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7]] then your custom iterator’s next() should return 4 after 3 and 6 after 5. Similarly, hasNext() will return false only at 7. I had to write the production level code.
